## Background Summary

I am a passionate technologist experienced in consultative sales and deployment of diverse technologies, with the knowledge and practice of effective analytical trouble resolution, a determined customer advocate, and the ability to learn, master and effectively communicate technology.

I am also a capable chef, knowledgeable in all stages of kitchen management and food preparation. And, when Iâ€™m not working, I enjoy photography focusing on abstract long-exposure monochromatic photographs.
